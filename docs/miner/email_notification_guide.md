# Email Notification Guide for Proof Submission

This guide describes how to configure and use the email notification feature in EthStorage's mining process. This feature is useful for storage providers or es-node operators who want to receive timely notifications about proof submissions and their results.

---

## How It Works

If enabled, storage providers will receive email notifications for the following mining events:

1. When the es-node is started and each of the local data shards is ready to mine. Note that on first startup, the node's local storage must synchronize via P2P to catch up with the network.
2. When a storage proof is generated and submitted to the smart contract as a mining transaction.

## SMTP Service Preparation

**You must have access to a working SMTP service to use the email notification feature.**  
If you do not already have an SMTP account, you need to apply for one yourself. Below are two common options:

### Gmail

- You can use your Gmail account as an SMTP sender.
- SMTP Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
- SMTP Port: `587`
- Reference: [Send email from a printer, scanner, or app](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en) (Option 2).

### Mailjet

- [Mailjet](https://app.mailjet.com/signup) is a third-party email service provider that offers free and paid SMTP services.
- SMTP Host: `in-v3.mailjet.com`
- SMTP Port: `587`
- Reference: [How can I configure my SMTP parameters?](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043229473-How-can-I-configure-my-SMTP-parameters)

For other providers, refer to their documentation for SMTP host, port, and credential setup.

## Email Configuration 

You can configure email notifications via CLI flags or environment variables. The most common way is to pass parameters to your node startup scripts where storage mining is enabled (e.g., `run.sh` or `run-l2.sh`):

```bash
  ...
  --miner.email-enabled \
  --email.username username@gmail.com \
  --email.host smtp.gmail.com \
  --email.port 587 \
  --email.from from@gmail.com \
  --email.to to1@gmail.com,to2@gmail.com \
  ...
```
Then execute the script with the SMTP password, miner address, and private key as environment variables:

```bash
env ES_NODE_STORAGE_MINER=0xabc... \
ES_NODE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0123... \
ES_NODE_EMAIL_PASSWORD="abcd  efgh  ijkl  mnop" \
./run.sh
```
### Quick Test for Your Email Configuration

You can run the `es-node email` command with your email configuration to quickly verify your email settings, as shown in the following example:

```bash
ES_NODE_EMAIL_PASSWORD="abcd  efgh  ijkl  mnop" \
./build/bin/es-node email \
  --email.username username@gmail.com \
  --email.host smtp.gmail.com \
  --email.port 587 \
  --email.from from@gmail.com \
  --email.to to@gmail.com
```
You will receive an email like the following if everything is correct:

```
This is a test email sent from the EthStorage node CLI.

## Parameter Reference

| CLI Flag                  | Environment Variable Name           | Description                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| --miner.email-enabled     | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_ENABLED         | Enable email notification for miner (default: false)|
| --email.username    | ES_NODE_EMAIL_USERNAME        | SMTP username or API key           |
| --email.password    | ES_NODE_EMAIL_PASSWORD        | SMTP password or API secret        |
| --email.host        | ES_NODE_EMAIL_HOST            | SMTP server host (default: smtp.gmail.com)|
| --email.port        | ES_NODE_EMAIL_PORT            | SMTP server port (default: 587)    |
| --email.from        | ES_NODE_EMAIL_FROM            | Sender email address               |
| --email.to          | ES_NODE_EMAIL_TO              | Recipient(s), repeated flags supported|

---
**Notes:**

- Keep your SMTP credentials secure.
- It is recommended to use the environment variable (`ES_NODE_EMAIL_PASSWORD`) for the password.
- If your password contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes.
- To specify multiple recipients, separate addresses with commas for the value of `--email.to`.
- To disable email notifications, either remove the flag `--miner.email-enabled`, or set `--miner.email-enabled=false`.
- The `--email.from` value **must be a valid email address** (no display name or angle brackets).
