## Introduction

This guide provides detailed steps for setting up a self-contained test environment for the OP Stack rollup, utilizing EthStorage as an archive service. 
The test framework is based on the Bedrock devnet but allows for separate control of Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2). The document explains how to configure and start all necessary components, including:
- L1 that serves as RPC endpoint and Beacon API, 
- Rollup services such as op-geth, sequencer, batcher,  proposer, etc., plus an extra rollup node in validator mode on L2, 
- The deployment of EthStorage contracts and the BatchInbox contract that help to store batch data into EthStorage. 
- Launch an EthStorage node (es-node) in archiver mode. 

You will have an intuitive experience and clear understanding of the difference made by EthStorage archive service as a long-term data availability solution.

## Preparations

### Software Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Version Check Command        |
|------------|---------|------------------------------|
| git        | ^2      | `git --version`              |
| go         | ^1.21   | `go version`                 |
| node       | ^20     | `node --version`             |
| foundry    | ^0.2.0  | `forge --version`            |
| make       | ^3      | `make --version`             |
| jq         | ^1.6    | `jq --version`               |
| direnv     | ^2      | `direnv --version`           |
| docker     | ^27     | `docker --version`			  |


### Getting the Correct Code Branch

First, clone the Optimism monorepo and check out the branch `long-term-da`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethstorage/optimism.git
cd optimism
git checkout long-term-da
```
Now you can run the following command to check the dependencies in your system:

```bash
./packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/getting-started/versions.sh
```
Especially, if `direnv` is not installed yet:
```bash
apt install direnv
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Source of Gas

Locate the private key that contains enough balance for later transactions in `ops-bedrock/op-batcher-key.txt`, 
and store the private key in your environment:
```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=bf7604d9d3a1c7748642b1b7b05c2bd219c9faa91458b370f85e5a40f3b03af7
```

### Filling Out Environment Variables

To configure the environment variables, begin by copying the example configuration file:
```
cp .envrc.example .envrc
``` 

Edit the `.envrc` file to include the necessary environment variables:

```bash
export L1_CHAIN_ID=900
export L1_BLOCK_TIME=12

export L2_CHAIN_ID=901
export L2_BLOCK_TIME=2

export L1_RPC_KIND=debug_geth
export L1_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545

export PRIVATE_KEY=bf7604d9d3a1c7748642b1b7b05c2bd219c9faa91458b370f85e5a40f3b03af7
```

## L1 Setup

### Starting L1

While still in the Optimism monorepo, execute the following command:
```bash
make devnet-up-l1
```
This command will start the following services:

- Container ops-bedrock-l1-1
- Container ops-bedrock-l1-bn-1
- Container ops-bedrock-l1-vc-1

Now, navigate to the parent directory in preparation for the next steps.

### Running a Proxy of L1 Beacon to Mock Short Retention Period of Blobs

The following commands start a proxy to Beacon API with a shorter blob retention period:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethstorage/beacon-api-wrapper.git
cd beacon-api-wrapper
go run cmd/main.go -b http://localhost:5052 -p 3602 -r 3
```
If a blob request is within the latest 3 epochs or 96 slots, the proxy will retrieve blobs from the Beacon URL (`http://localhost:5052`). For requests older than that, it will return an empty list.
This setup allows you to test the archive service effectively. 

Now, navigate to the parent directory in preparation for the next steps.

## EthStorage Setup

### Deploying EthStorage Contracts

Begin by cloning the EthStorage contract repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethstorage/storage-contracts-v1.git
cd storage-contracts-v1
git checkout op-devnet
npm run install:all
``` 

Create a `.env` file and populate it with the following content:
```
L1_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
PRIVATE_KEY=bf7604d9d3a1c7748642b1b7b05c2bd219c9faa91458b370f85e5a40f3b03af7
```

Now, deploy the contract with the Hardhat framework:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network op_devnet
```
Make sure to save the **storage contract address** for future use. For example:

```hash
export ES_CONTRACT=0x9B75f686F348d18AF9A4b98e0290D24350d742c4  # replace with the actual address
```
Now, navigate to the parent directory in preparation for the next steps.


### Building EthStorage Node

To set up the es-node, first, clone the repository and build it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethstorage/es-node.git
cd es-node
git checkout v0.1.16
make
```

### Initializing EthStorage Node

Initialize es-node:
```bash
./init-rpc.sh \
--l1.rpc http://localhost:8545 \
--storage.l1contract $ES_CONTRACT
```

### Running ES Node in Archiver Mode

Retrieve the beacon genesis time for later use:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5052/eth/v1/beacon/genesis | jq -r '.data.genesis_time'

1732529739

export GENESIS_TIME=1732529739 # replace with the actual timestamp
```

Note: Before proceeding to the next step of launching the es-node, ensure that at least 2 epochs (approximately 13 minutes) have passed since the EthStorage contracts were deployed in [this step](#deploying-ethstorage-contracts), as the es-node needs to read the finalized states of the contract.

Finally, run the es-node:

```bash
./run-rpc.sh \
--storage.l1contract $ES_CONTRACT \
--l1.rpc http://localhost:8545 \
--l1.beacon http://localhost:5052 \
--l1.beacon-based-time $GENESIS_TIME \
--l1.beacon-based-slot 0 \
--p2p.listen.udp 30375 \
--p2p.listen.tcp 9733 \
--rpc.port 9745 \
--archiver.port 6678 \
--archiver.enabled 
```

Shortly after the es-node starts, it will listen for the storage contract, download all blobs managed by the contract, and store them locally. In this instance, it collects all the blobs received by the BatchInbox contract. The es-node also serves blob queries in the format `/eth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars/{slot}` on port 6678, similar to the Beacon API.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the es-node designed solely for data access. In a standard EthStorage network, a p2p network is formed by storage providers who secure the data using a sophisticated proof-of-storage algorithm. For detailed information, please refer to [the documentation](docs.ethstorage.io).

Now, navigate to the parent directory in preparation for the next steps.

## L2 Setup

### Deploying BatchInbox Contract

Clone and build the BatchInbox contract:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethstorage/es-op-batchinbox.git
cd es-op-batchinbox
```

Deploy the BatchInbox contract:
```bash
forge create src/BatchInbox.sol:BatchInbox  \
--broadcast \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
--constructor-args $ES_CONTRACT
```

It should output like 
```bash
Deployer: 0xDe3829A23DF1479438622a08a116E8Eb3f620BB5
Deployed to: 0xb860F42DAeD06Cf3dC9C3b4B8A287523BbdB2B1e
Transaction hash: 0x99f6788e90004a68e67fa2848e47f7592ffb38aaff31b1738bcc163d806a00a5
```

Make sure to save the deployed contract address for future use. For example:

```bash
export BATCH_INBOX=0xb860F42DAeD06Cf3dC9C3b4B8A287523BbdB2B1e  # replace with the actual address
```

Do not forget to fund the batcher in the BatchInbox account, where `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC` is the batcher address used in the devnet:
```bash
cast send $BATCH_INBOX "deposit(address)" 0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC --value 100ether --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Finally, navigate to the Optimism monorepo and locate `batchInboxAddress` in the file `packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/devnetL1.json`:

```json
  "batchInboxAddress": "0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000901",
```
Update the value of `batchInboxAddress` with the address of the contract you just deployed. 

### Running L2

In the Optimism monorepo, start the Layer 2 environment by executing the following command:
```bash
make devnet-up-l2
```

This command will start the following services:
- Container ops-bedrock-l2-1
- Container ops-bedrock-op-batcher-1
- Container ops-bedrock-op-node-1
- Container ops-bedrock-op-proposer-1
- Container ops-bedrock-op-challenger-1
- Container ops-bedrock-artifact-server-1

Now, navigate to the parent directory in preparation for the next steps.

The following steps will add an additional OP Stack instance in validator mode only download blobs from the Beacon API proxy at first. 

### Starting OP Geth

Clone the OP Geth repository and build it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth.git
cd op-geth
git checkout v1.101408.0

make geth
```
Initialize the OP Geth with devnet genesis configuration.
```bash
./build/bin/geth init --state.scheme=hash --datadir=datadir ../optimism/.devnet/genesis-l2.json
```

Copy the test jwt secret:
```bash
cp ../optimism/ops-bedrock/test-jwt-secret.txt jwt.txt
```

Start the OP Geth process:
```bash
./build/bin/geth \
  --datadir ./datadir \
  --http \
  --http.corsdomain="*" \
  --http.vhosts="*" \
  --http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --http.port=5545 \
  --http.api=web3,debug,eth,txpool,net,engine \
  --ws \
  --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --ws.port=5546 \
  --ws.origins="*" \
  --ws.api=debug,eth,txpool,net,engine \
  --syncmode=full \
  --gcmode=archive \
  --nodiscover \
  --maxpeers=0 \
  --networkid=901 \
  --port=30503 \
  --authrpc.vhosts="*" \
  --authrpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --authrpc.port=5551 \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true
```

Now, navigate to the parent directory in preparation for the next steps.

### Starting OP Node

Note: To ensure that the new OP Stack instance is trying to derived from the "expired" blobs, you may need to wait for at least 96 slots before starting the next steps, according to the setting of the Beacon proxy.

Enter the Optimism monorepo and execute the following commands to start op-node as a validator:

```bash
make op-node

./op-node/bin/op-node \
  --l2=http://localhost:5551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./ops-bedrock/test-jwt-secret.txt \
  --sequencer.enabled=false \
  --p2p.disable \
  --verifier.l1-confs=4 \
  --rollup.config=.devnet/rollup.json \
  --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
  --rpc.port=9945 \
  --rpc.enable-admin \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND \
  --l1.beacon=http://localhost:3602 
```

**Note:**
1. P2P is disabled so that it can only sync data from L1.
2. The L1 beacon URL is directed to the beacon proxy, where blobs expire quickly.

You can observe that the validator node is unable to sync properly with "derivation failed" error due to "failed to fetch blobs", which is an expected result because there is no way to retrieve the expired blobs.

### Restarting OP Node With the Archiver Configured

Now, stop the running op-node, and re-start op-node with the same command in [the last step](#starting-op-node) but with an extra option:

```bash
--l1.beacon-archiver http://localhost:6678
```
Note that the beacon archiver is configured to point to the es-node archive service.  

## Verifying Sync Status

During the synchronization process, you can check that the validator node queries expired blobs from the es-node archive service. You may need to temporarily stop the validator node to allow the blobs to expire.

Additionally, you can verify the correctness of the expired blob data by ensuring that the synced L2 blocks are identical across both nodes.

For example:
```bash
# query block from the sequencer
cast block 3000 -f hash -r http://127.0.0.1:9545

# query block from the validator
cast block 3000 -f hash -r http://127.0.0.1:5545
```

## Conclusion

By following the instructions above, you will successfully configure and deploy each component of the OP Stack rollup with the EthStorage archive service as its long-term data availability solution. Additionally, you will verify that the EthStorage archive service functions accurately providing correct blob data after the blobs from the Beacon chain have expired.
