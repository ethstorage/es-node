## Milestones & TODO list

- Public testnet for EthStorage in Cancun testnet (Should be Goerli)
  - es-node
    - [P2P performance test](https://github.com/ethstorage/go-ethstorage/pull/66) (Ping)
    - Use EIP-4788 to read the beacon block hash and query BLOB data from the CL (Qiang) (Low Priority)
    - [Improve encoding performance to decrease the time of filling empty data](https://github.com/ethstorage/es-node/issues/6)
  - es-geth
    - Increase the gas limit of es-geth to support more BLOB reading and concatenation in the users' contract (Qiang)
    - Support different encode/decode algorithms for DA BLOB data (31/32, raw) (Qiang) (Low Priority)
    - Setup an es-node with encoding type 0 (means that no need to decode when serving the data) (Qiang)
  - storage-contract-v1
    - [Support batch put](https://github.com/ethstorage/storage-contracts-v1/issues/17) (need to clarify the fee calculation issue)
    - [Assign a valid diff when opening a new shard](https://github.com/ethstorage/storage-contracts-v1/issues/23) (DL)
  - Public repo for es-node
    - Readme
      - Explain all of the cmd flags in case the node operators want to customize their es-node
      - Module explanation (p2p, miner, downloader, and shard manager)
  - Testnet setup
    - 3 es-nodes: one for boot node, the 2nd is for encoding type 3 and the 3rd is for encoding type 0
    - A full node for Ethereum testnet and replace the geth with es-geth
  - Goerli test ETH
  - Doc website to explain the core concepts, how to run testnet, etc. (Very important to onboard newcomer)
  - Dashboard to show the activity on EthStorage
  - One demo dApp - W3Box (Mingpeng)
      - make gateway compatible with ethstorage
  - A demo to show how OP will use EthStorage to store their tx
- Next
  - Allow submitting a storage proof based on a recent storage state to avoid the "front-run writing attack"
  - Integrate a more efficient encode written in rust
  - [A circuit to verify multiple sampling on multiple blobs](https://github.com/ethstorage/storage-contracts-v1/issues/20)
  - [Update verifier.sol due to the old one's bug](https://github.com/ethstorage/storage-contracts-v1/pull/10) (Not a high priority because we may change to a new ZK prover)
  - Replace Snark.js with Gnark for better performance (Not a high priority because we may change to a new ZK prover)
  - Docs for dApps developers who want to use EthStorage
  - Portal network integration with ES
  - OP batch inbox contract demo
  - ES build on Celestia / EigenDA
  - KYVE / Mantle
