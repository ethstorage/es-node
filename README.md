# es-node

Golang implementation of the EthStorage node.

EthStorage is a storage-specific L2 network that reuses Ethereum security to extend Ethereum storage capabilities via data availability technology.

Storage providers can join the L2 network permissionlessly by running an es-node. They need to download the replica of the L2 data into their local node, submit [proof of storage](#about-proof-of-storage) to the L1 EthStorage contract, and get the corresponding reward once the proof is accepted by the contract.

## About Proof of Storage

To check if a replica of data is indeed physically stored, the storage providers need to randomly sample the encoded BLOBs with unique storage provider ID (miner address) and submit the proofs to the L1 storage contract for verification over time. That is how storage providers collect their storage fees.

The continuous random sampling needs to satisfy a difficulty parameter that will be adjusted on-chain similarly to Ethash difficulty adjustment algorithm. So the Proof of Storage process sometimes is referred to as _`mining`_.

To get ready to generate and submit the proof of storage, you need to prepare a miner address to generate unique physical replicas and receive storage fees, as well as a private key to sign the transactions that submit the storage proofs.

## Minimum Hardware Requirements 

The minimum hardware requirements for an es-node are as follows:

 - CPU: A minimum of 4 cores and 8 threads
 - 4GB of RAM
 - Disk: 
    - We recommend using an NVMe disk to support the full speed of sampling
    - At least 550 GB of available storage space for the runtime and sync of one data shard
 - Internet service: At least 8MB/sec download speed

## Getting started

To start an es-node, you have the option to run a manually built binary or with Docker. The `run.sh` script is used as an entry point in all the above options. The main function of the script is to initialize the data file, prepare for [Proof of Storage](#about-proof-of-storage), and launch es-node with preset parameters. 
[Proof of Storage](#about-proof-of-storage) is enabled by default by the `--miner.enabled` flag in `run.sh`, which means you become a storage provider when you start an es-node with default settings.

Refer to [here](/GUIDE.md) for a quick start to run an es-node to connect to the current EthStorage devnet.

Alternatively, refer to [here](/SETUP.md) for a quick start to set up your own EIP-4844 devnet and EthStorage devnet.

_Note: Some of the flags/parameters used in `run.sh` are supposed to change over time. Refer to [configuration](#configuration) for a full list._


## Configuration

### Configuration to create data files

With `es-node init` command, you can init your es-node by creating a data file for each shard.

You can specify `shard_len` (the number of shards) or `shard_index` (the index of specified shards, and you can specify more than one) to create shards that you would like to mine. If both appear, `shard_index` takes precedence. 

Here are the options that you can use with `init` command:

|Name|Description|Default|Required|
|---|---|---|---|
|`--datadir`|Data directory for the storage files, databases and keystore||✓|
