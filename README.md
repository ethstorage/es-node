# es-node

Golang implementation of the EthStorage node.

EthStorage is a storage-specific L2 network that reuses Ethereum security to extend Ethereum storage capabilities via data availability technology.

Storage providers can join the L2 network permissionlessly by running an es-node. They need to download the replica of the L2 data into their local node, submit [proof of storage](#about-proof-of-storage) to the L1 EthStorage contract, and get the corresponding reward once the proof is accepted by the contract.

## Quick start

Refer to [here](/GUIDE.md) for a quick start to run an es-node.

Alternatively, refer to [here](/SETUP.md) for a quick start to set up your own EIP-4844 devnet and EthStorage devnet.

_Note: It is assumed that you are using the `root` user in the all the command line operations. You may need to add `sudo` before some of the commands if you are using a non-root user._

## Getting started
To start an es-node, you have the option to run [a manually built binary](#build-and-run-es-node), with [Docker managed by docker compose](#docker-compose), with [Docker managed by `run-docker.sh` and run in the background](#docker-as-a-background-process), or with [manually built Docker](#docker).

The `run.sh` script is used as an entry point in all the above options. The main function of the script is to initialize the data file, prepare for [Proof of Storage](#about-proof-of-storage), and launch es-node with preset parameters.

[Proof of Storage](#about-proof-of-storage) is enabled by default by the `--miner.enabled` flag in `run.sh`, which means you become a storage provider when you start an es-node with default settings.

_Note: Some of the flags/parameters used in `run.sh` are supposed to change over time._

### About Proof of Storage

To check if a replica of data is indeed physically stored, the storage providers need to randomly sample the encoded BLOBs with unique storage provider ID (miner address) and submit the proofs to the L1 storage contract for verification over time. That is how storage providers collect their storage fees.

The continuous random sampling needs to satisfy a difficulty parameter that will be adjusted on-chain similarly to Ethash difficulty adjustment algorithm. So the Proof of Storage process sometimes is referred to as _`mining`_.

To get ready to generate and submit the proof of storage, you need to prepare a miner address to generate unique physical replicas and receive storage fees, as well as a private key to sign the transactions that submit the storage proofs.

It is recommended to use different accounts for the signer and the miner.

_Note: You need to have some ETH balance in the account of the private key as the gas fee to submit transactions._

### How to launch an es-node with binary

#### Environment
Please make sure that the following packages are pre-installed.

* go 1.20 or above
* node 16 or above

Also, you will need to install `snarkjs` for the generation of zk proof.
```sh
npm install -g snarkjs@0.7.0
```
#### Build and run es-node
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethstorage/es-node.git

# build
cd es-node/cmd/es-node && go build && cd ../..

# run
chmod +x run.sh
env ES_NODE_STORAGE_MINER=<miner> ES_NODE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key> ./run.sh
```
### How to launch an es-node with Docker

_Note: Currently, you will need to build the Docker image locally from es-node source code. So please download the source code and execute the following commands in the top folder of es-node repository._

#### Environment

- Docker version 24.0.5 or above

#### Docker compose
To start es-node with `docker compose`, pull es-node source code and execute the following command in the repo:
```sh
env ES_NODE_STORAGE_MINER=<miner> ES_NODE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key> docker compose up 
```
#### Docker as a background process
Or you can use `run-docker.sh` that builds an es-node Docker image and launches a container in the background:
```sh
env ES_NODE_STORAGE_MINER=<miner> ES_NODE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key> ./run-docker.sh
```
Then check logs by
```sh
docker logs -f es 
```
Where `es` is the name of the es-node container.

Optionally, if you prefer a colorful log displayed, try the following:
```sh
# install grc if not yet
apt-get install grc
# show colorful log
docker logs -f es | grcat conf.log
```

#### Docker
To build Docker image and launch a container manually, execute:
```sh
# build image
docker build -t es-node .
# start container
docker run -v ./es-data:/es-node/es-data -e ES_NODE_STORAGE_MINER=<miner> -e ES_NODE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key> -p 9545:9545 -p 9222:9222 -p 30305:30305/udp -it --entrypoint /es-node/run.sh es-node
```
Where `es-node` is the name of the es-node image.

### Launch an es-node as bootnode

To launch a bootnode for the es-node network, you need to modify the `run.sh` file by adding the `--p2p.advertise.ip` flag: 
```sh
# replace <your_ip_address> with your ip address the other nodes can access.
--p2p.advertise.ip <your_ip_address> \
``` 
to replace the line with the `--p2p.bootnodes` flag:
```sh
--p2p.bootnodes enr:... \
```
Then, soon after the bootnode is started up, you can find the base64 encoded enr value prefixed with `enr:` in the log. 

Next, you will need to replace the enr value of `--p2p.bootnodes` flag in other nodes with the new one to connect to the bootnode.
