// measurementImpact is the impact a single measurement has on a peer's final

// Tracker estimates the throughput capacity of a peer with regard to each data
// type it can deliver. The goal is to dynamically adjust request sizes to max
// out network throughput without overloading either the peer or th elocal node.
//
// By tracking in real time the latencies and bandiwdths peers exhibit for each
// packet type, it's possible to prevent overloading by detecting a slowdown on
// one type when another type is pushed too hard.
//
// Similarly, real time measurements also help avoid overloading the local net
// connection if our peers would otherwise be capable to deliver more, but the
// local link is saturated. In that case, the live measurements will force us
// to reduce request sizes until the throughput gets stable.
//
// Lastly, message rate measurements allows us to detect if a peer is unsuaully
// slow compared to other peers, in which case we can decide to keep it around
// or free up the slot so someone closer.
//
// Since throughput tracking and estimation adapts dynamically to live network
// conditions, it's fine to have multiple trackers locally track the same peer
// in different subsystem. The throughput will simply be distributed across the
// two trackers if both are highly active.

// errors and will add an additional overestimation ratio on top. The reason for
// overshooting the capacity is because certain message types might not increase
// the load proportionally to the requested items, so fetching a bit more might
// still take the same RTT. By forcefully overshooting by a small amount, we can
// avoid locking into a lower-that-real capacity.
