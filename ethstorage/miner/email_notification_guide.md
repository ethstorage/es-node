# Email Notification Guide for Proof Submission

This guide describes how to configure and use the email notification feature in EthStorage's mining process. This feature is useful for storage providers or es-node operators who want to receive timely notifications about proof submissions and their results.

## Parameter Reference

| CLI Flag                  | Environment Variable Name           | Description                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| --miner.email-username    | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_USERNAME        | SMTP username or API key           |
| --miner.email-password    | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_PASSWORD        | SMTP password or API secret        |
| --miner.email-host        | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_HOST            | SMTP server host (default: smtp.gmail.com)|
| --miner.email-port        | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_PORT            | SMTP server port (default: 587)    |
| --miner.email-from        | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_FROM            | Sender email address               |
| --miner.email-to          | ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_TO              | Recipient(s), repeated flags       |

## Usage

You can configure email notifications via CLI flags or environment variables. The most common way is to pass parameters to your node startup scripts with storage mining enabled (e.g., `run.sh` or `run-l2.sh`):

```bash
  ...
  --miner.email-username username@gmail.com \
  --miner.email-host smtp.gmail.com \
  --miner.email-port 587 \
  --miner.email-from from@gmail.com \
  --miner.email-to to@gmail.com \
  ...
```
Then execute the script with the SMTP password, miner address, and private key as environment variables:

```bash
env ES_NODE_STORAGE_MINER=0xabc... \
ES_NODE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0123... \
ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_PASSWORD="abcd  efgh  ijkl  mnop" \
./run.sh
```

**Notes:**

- Keep SMTP credentials secure.
- It is recommended to use the environment variable (`ES_NODE_MINER_EMAIL_PASSWORD`) for the password.
- If your password contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes.
- To support multiple recipients, use the CLI flag (`--miner.email-to`) repeatedly to assign different email addresses.
- To disable email notifications, simply leave `--miner.email-to` empty.
- The `--miner.email-from` value **must be a valid email address** (no display name or angle brackets).

#### Proof Dropped Due to Low Profit

```
Subject: EthStorage Proof Submission: ❌ Failure

A storage proof was generated by es-node for shard 1 at block 12345.

However, it was dropped due to insufficient profit.
```

#### Transaction Submission Failed
