# ZK Prover
### Introduction
ZK prover generates zk proofs to prove that a correct encoding mask is computed using Poseidon hash algorithm.

### Implementation
Currently the `Groth16` scheme is used as the prove system, and it is implemented using `go-rapidsnark`.

### Environment requirements

To build es-node with `rapidsnark`, the packages `build-essential` and `libomp-dev packages` are required on an Ubuntu system.

Note that a product version `.zkey` file in `snark_lib` folder should be used in the product environment instead of the current version from google drive.

### Performance 

Rapidsnark vs snarkjs proofing time on my MBP (2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7) and AX101

proving time | snarkjs | rapidsnark
-- | -- | -- 
MBP | 32.6 s | 5 s
AX101 | 10.23 s | 2.45 s

Rapidsnark already fully uses all the CPU cores on the host machine, so we do not need to run multiple proves concurrently to improve the efficiency.

Go-rapidsnark also provides the go version of the witness calculator, so that our prover can go rid of the nodejs and snarkjs dependencies while gaining faster proving.

We also need to investigate the gnark to decide whether we want to choose it or rapidsnark, but at least we have a better alternative than snarkjs

### Performance updates

MBP 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9

 Implementation  | Proof per sample (mode 1) | Proof for 2 samples (mode 2) 
-- | -- | -- 
snarkjs | 43.8  |  60.1
rapidsnark + wazero.Circom2WZWitnessCalculator |  47.1 | 82.3
rapidsnark + wasmer.Circom2WitnessCalculator | 49.5 | 101.8


AX101

 Implementation  | Proof per sample (mode 1) | Proof for 2 samples (mode 2) 
-- | -- | -- 
snarkjs | 12.6  |  24.4
rapidsnark + wazero.Circom2WZWitnessCalculator |  5.7 | 14.1
rapidsnark + wasmer.Circom2WitnessCalculator | 10.2 | 17.5

Note rapidsnark supports 2 witness calculator implementations which `wazero` wins.

With `-tags rapidsnark_asm` AX101 has an obvious improvement, esp. mode2ï¼š

 Implementation  | Proof per sample (mode 1) | Proof for 2 samples (mode 2) 
-- | -- | -- 
rapidsnark + wazero.Circom2WZWitnessCalculator |  5.7 | 14.1
rapidsnark + wazero.Circom2WZWitnessCalculator + `-tags rapidsnark_asm` |  4.6 | 8.2

But this is not the case for Mac. MacOS build has the optimization enabled according to [the go-rapidsnark doc](https://github.com/iden3/go-rapidsnark/tree/main/prover#performance-optimization-on-x86_64-hardware).
