# EthStorage Public Testnet 1 Onboarding Guide

Welcome aboard EthStorage Public Testnet 1. The Ethereum Dencun upgrade for the Sepolia testnet was successfully completed on January 30. Following this significant upgrade, the EthStorage team deployed its public testnet on Sepolia. Here's a brief introduction to what you can expect:

- EthStorage offers a modular and decentralized Layer 2 storage solution on the Ethereum blockchain, featuring programmable key-value storage powered by Data Availability (DA). It supports permanent storage for EIP-4844 BLOBs, enhancing Rollups and enabling a broad spectrum of fully on-chain applications, including games, social networks, and AI, among others. 
- Operating an EthStorage node requires at least 550GB of NVMe disk space, which corresponds to the shard size for proof of storage. To date, our team has successfully uploaded more than 2 million BLOBs into this shard. We warmly invite anyone interested in leveraging EthStorage for their projects to upload their data as well.
- Storage Providers earn ETH rewards by running an EthStorage node and submitting storage proofs to the EthStorage contract. The target interval for submitting storage proofs is set at 3 hours. If a Storage Provider successfully submits a storage proof 3 hours after the last submission, they can earn approximately 0.1 ETH as a reward.
- Storage Providers can check how many storage proofs they've submitted, their ETH profit, and their ranking in the [dashboard](https://grafana.ethstorage.io).
- Find the [tutorial](https://docs.ethstorage.io/storage-provider-guide/tutorials) for quickly launching an es-node.
- Learn how to check the status after launching an es-node [here](https://docs.ethstorage.io/storage-provider-guide/tutorials#two-phases-after-es-node-launch), and for additional information, consult the [FAQ](https://docs.ethstorage.io/storage-provider-guide/storage-provider-faq).
- Please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xhCwaMp7ps) for any questions, and stay informed about news of EthStorage by following our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EthStorage) account.

For those interested in exploring the Dencun upgrade, we've developed a tool named [eth-blob-uploader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-blob-uploader). This tool allows you to upload any local file using EIP-4844 BLOBs, and you can inspect these data on-chain with [blobscan](https://blobscan.com).
